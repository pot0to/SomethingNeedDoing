goonish thoughts
I want to farm decumana as well. how shall we approach this problem.


farm prae until 99 pare done for the day.
farm decumana until 1 am PDT

repeat

Script start ->
intialize table
date - prae runs - porta runs

Start of loop
check date, check prae runs, if <99, we will pick prae in the DF menu, otherwise we pick Porta
DF check -> clear selection? Pick the right duty?
check area if its not (1044 or 1045) flag as outside,  and entered = 0
if area is (1044 or 1045) and entered == 0 flag as inside, and entered = 1
	log update incremeber for appropriate dungeon
